## Dream Journal
Project 4 built during my Software Engineering Immersive Course at General Assembly.

Built using: MongoDB/Mongoose, Flask, React, Node. This is backend repo for dream journal, containing all server-side code responsible for handling requests, processing data, and generating responses. The frontend code and detailed readme for this project is available in [this repository](https://github.com/adelyntay/dream-tracker-frontend)

Dream Journal enables users to record details about their dreams, including dream type and sleep quality. The app aims to help users identify any correlations between their sleep and dream experiences. Users can share their dreams with others and receive feedback/comment through the app's discussion page.
